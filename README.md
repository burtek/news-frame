# news-frame

**news-frame** is a private DIY, PoC project for Raspberry Pi Zero W. Written in C++, utilizing RPi Zero W, [Waveshare 640x384 7.5inch E-Ink display](https://www.waveshare.com/7.5inch-e-Paper-HAT-C.htm), RGB LEDs and a few buttons, it aims at being all-in-one interactive kiosk for home, displaying important news and anything else one would want it to display.

Since it is the very beginning of development, not much can be added now. Schematics and photos will be added to Wiki later on.
